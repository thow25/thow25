In 1993 a computer scientist by the name of Yukihiro Matsumoto came up with an idea to create a programming language that would make 
programmers happy with its power and its simplicity. In 1995 Matsumoto released a programming language by the name of Ruby   
to the public and Ruby has now become one of the the most popular programming languages in the world. 
Ruby combines key concepts and features from both the scripting language Perl and the Object-oriented language Python to create 
a programming language that achieves Matsumoto's goal of being exceptionally powerful, yet simple to learn.
In this presentation we will go over the history of Ruby and the features that Ruby brings to the programmers who use it, 
as well as the reasons behind Ruby's popularity. At the conclusion of the presentation we will see an example application 
that uses some of the features that Ruby incorporates.
